<!-- Question 1 -->

On the enrollments tab, we see that an enrollment has columns student_id and course_id.
Find any two students enrolled in the Intro to Programming - Spring 2025 course and fill in the following template for each matching student row:
<student id>, <student email>

40, sherman@kerluke-borer.test
33, lucio@collins.example

    courses = Course.where(trimester_id: 5, coding_class_id: 1)

    students = Enrollment.where(course_id: courses)

    students.each do |student|
        ids = student.student_id
        contact = Student.find_by(id:ids)
        puts ids, contact.email
    end

<!-- Question 2 -->
 
Our next task is to email all the mentors for students in the current (Spring 2025) Intro to Programming course who do not yet have a final grade (on the enrollments tab), so that we can remind them to finish grading.
Reference the following sheets: mentor_enrollment_assignments, enrollments, courses, coding_classes, trimesters, mentors,
Find any two mentors who have not assigned a final grade for students in a Spring 2025 course. For each mentor, complete the following template:
<mentor id>, <mentor email>

    25, valery@jakubowski-borer.example
    26, ahmad@watsica-mosciski.test

    courses = Course.where(trimester_id: 5, coding_class_id: 1)

    gradeless = Enrollment.where(course_id: courses, final_grade: nil)

    mentors = MentorEnrollmentAssignment.where(enrollment_id: gradeless)

    mentors.each do |mentor|
        mentor_list = Mentor.find_by(id: mentor.mentor_id)
        puts mentor.mentor_id, mentor_list.email
    end
